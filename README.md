# Deep Learning Hands-on

Following ![Banyutong/deep_learning_hands_on](https://github.com/Banyutong/deep_learning_hands_on)

## Session 2 & 3

```python
from torch.nn.parallel import data_parallel
```

This line seems to be automatically added to my code after the first run.

## Session 4

```python
# Final size: 1000, 20, 1
# Default LSTM layer input: sequence length, batch size, input size
```

The scale doesn't match seemingly.

The test set is 100 same sine waves. But I found out that the 100 results seem to be different when I print them.
